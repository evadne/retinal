#	Retinal

Retinal is one tiny Illustrator script that makes supporting `@2x` PNGs easy.  Install this script in Illustrator’s script directory, and run it when you need to export images.

Since Retinal is written using Illustrator CS5’s new JavaScript APIs, it will not run on older versions of Illustrator.





##	Installation

Put the script in `<Illustrator.app>/../Presets/<Locale>/Scripts`.  Aliases won’t work, and omitting `<Locale>` won’t, either.  

If you’d like to access this script with a keyboard shortcut, try making a new action, then use Insert Menu Item in the action panel’s menu to assign the script to the action, then assign a shortcut on the action.










##	Would Implement…

*	A progress indicator, or maybe a Growl notification.
